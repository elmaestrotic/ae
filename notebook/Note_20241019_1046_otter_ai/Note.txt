Unknown Speaker  00:03
I ever feel like some people just like they're wired differently when it comes to learning? Well, today we're diving into a theory that might just explain why that is okay, experiential learning theory, ELT, or ELT. And what's

Unknown Speaker  00:15
fascinating about ELT, what's really interesting is that it goes beyond just saying some folks are visual learners, some are auditory it dives into how our experiences our actions, actually shape the way we understand and process the world around us.

Unknown Speaker  00:33
Okay, so let's unpack this a little bit. Sure we've got some seriously insightful articles and research for this deep dive, okay, including excerpts from, I mean, the pioneer of ELT himself, David a colt.

Unknown Speaker  00:46
And get this, ELT says learning isn't just about passively absorbing information. It's about actively creating knowledge through experience. So think back to a time you learned something. You really learned it. Chances are you didn't just read about it in a textbook. You lived it somehow, right?

Unknown Speaker  01:05
Like that time I tried to assemble furniture without reading the instructions exactly. Talk about a learning experience

Unknown Speaker  01:11
that's ELT in action. Yeah? You dove into the experience. Yeah, I did hit first. You probably reflected on what went

Unknown Speaker  01:20
wrong with a few choice words,

Unknown Speaker  01:22
you thought about how to improve, yeah, and then

Unknown Speaker  01:25
hopefully you applied that learning to the next step. So

Unknown Speaker  01:27
it's a cycle, kind of like a learning spiral, yeah, precisely, okay. And

Unknown Speaker  01:31
each loop of that spiral is shaped by our individual learning style, okay, our preferred way of experiencing, reflecting, thinking and acting.

Unknown Speaker  01:40
Now, we've all heard about learning styles. I feel like we have. But David, a cold took it a step further. Okay? He didn't just identify different styles, right? He explored how these preferences play out in real life, from the classroom to our career choices even. And this

Unknown Speaker  01:58
is where it gets really interesting, because understanding your learning style can be a game changer. Okay, especially if you've ever felt a disconnect between your natural inclinations and the way you're supposed to learn or work. So

Unknown Speaker  02:11
let's dive into these learning styles. Sure, shall we? Let's do it. Kolb identified four basic styles, okay, diverging, assimilating, converging and accommodating. Now,

Unknown Speaker  02:23
keep in mind, these aren't rigid categories. Think of them more like starting points, okay, like they're understanding your learning strengths. Yeah, it's like having a favorite color. You might gravitate towards blue, but you can still appreciate a fiery sunset.

Unknown Speaker  02:37
Yeah, absolutely know what I mean. Totally. Yeah. Okay, so first up diverging? Yes, these are the folks who see the world from a million different angles. Yes, they're the Brainstormers, the idea generators, and

Unknown Speaker  02:49
if you're picturing a room full of artists and free thinkers, you're on the right track. Yeah. Kolb's research found that people with a diverging style often gravitate toward fields like the arts and humanities makes sense, right? They

Unknown Speaker  03:01
thrive in environments where they can explore different perspectives and express themselves creatively.

Unknown Speaker  03:06
Exactly. Okay, then we have the assimilating style. These learners are all about connecting the dots, making sense of information by putting it into a logical framework.

Unknown Speaker  03:18
They're the ones who love to delve into research, yeah, analyze data and build, like, a really comprehensive understanding exactly, think, scientists, researchers, even some types of engineers. Yes, okay, next up

Unknown Speaker  03:33
the converging style. Okay, if the assimilating folks are building the theoretical framework, the converging folks are taking that framework and putting it to work. Okay? So these are the problem solvers, that's

Unknown Speaker  03:44
right, the practical thinkers. Exactly. They excel in fields where they can apply knowledge to real world challenges.

Unknown Speaker  03:51
You'll often find them in technical fields, engineering or any field where there's a focus on finding practical solutions,

Unknown Speaker  03:57
Okay, makes sense? Yeah, last but not least, we have the accommodating style. Yes, these are your hands on learners. That's right, the ones who learn best by doing, experimenting and frankly, sometimes failing. They're

Unknown Speaker  04:08
the adventures of the learning world.

Unknown Speaker  04:10
I like that. Always willing to jump into a new experience and figure things out as they go.

Unknown Speaker  04:15
And this is where Cole's research gets really eye opening. Okay? He found that art students, over time, often shifted toward more active learning styles, like accommodating

Unknown Speaker  04:26
and think about the environment they're in. It's all about hands on creation, experimentation and getting feedback in real time. Makes sense. It shows how the spaces we inhabit can actually influence our learning preferences. That's

Unknown Speaker  04:40
incredible. Like our brains adapt to the learning opportunities around us, it's amazing. So if you're feeling stuck in a rut, maybe it's not you, it's your environment. That's a

Unknown Speaker  04:50
powerful realization. It is,

Unknown Speaker  04:52
and it speaks to the importance of creating learning spaces that resonate with different styles, a concept called learning space. So we're

Unknown Speaker  05:00
talking about learning spaces. It's like, it sounds kind of sci fi, but yeah. I mean, it's actually a really cool concept. It is, when you really think about

Unknown Speaker  05:06
it, it's all about how our physical, social and even psychological environments impact how we learn. Think about it. Have you ever walked into a library and felt that sense of calm focus wash over you, you know,

Unknown Speaker  05:21
totally or like the opposite, you walk into, like, a really chaotic classroom, and you're like, Yes,

Unknown Speaker  05:25
I can't concentrate in here

Unknown Speaker  05:26
exactly.

Unknown Speaker  05:28
And what's fascinating is that Coke's research suggests we don't just adapt to these spaces. They actually gravitate towards those that resonate with our learning style. Okay, remember how we talked about art students shifting toward more active learning? Yeah, that's because art schools, with their studios and hands on projects, naturally foster that kind of

Unknown Speaker  05:48
learning. So it's not just about identifying your learning style, but then, like, yeah, seeking out those spaces, yes, whether physical or metaphorical, that amplify your strengths

Unknown Speaker  05:57
precisely. And this idea has huge implications, not just for how we learn individually, right, but for how we design educational systems. Oh, wow, workplaces, even our own personal development plans. Now

Unknown Speaker  06:09
you're speaking my language, yeah, imagine if schools weren't these like one size fits all factories, but instead offer diverse learning environments tailored to different styles and

Unknown Speaker  06:19
workplaces that recognize that a team of divergers might brainstorm brilliantly, but need some convergers to help channel those ideas into action,

Unknown Speaker  06:28
right? This is blowing my mind, like we've been trying to fit the square peg into the round hole, right when we've been designing spaces that celebrate those differences. It's a paradigm shift

Unknown Speaker  06:38
for sure, holy and it requires us to challenge some deeply ingrained assumptions, okay, especially in higher education. Yeah, Kolb was actually quite critical of the push for early specialization, right, arguing that it can stifle the very integrative thinking that ELT champions. That's

Unknown Speaker  06:58
so interesting. I never thought about it like that. Yeah, he uses the example of Harvard University, right?

Unknown Speaker  07:02
He does back in the late 1800s Okay? Harvard's President Charles Eliot introduced electives, right to give students more choice. It was a radical idea at the time, yeah, but it reflected a growing trend towards specialization across many fields, and

Unknown Speaker  07:17
that trend, like exploded in the 20th century, right? Did With advancements in science and technology, and we needed experts in these increasingly specialized areas, right? But what Kolb

Unknown Speaker  07:27
and others are now recognizing is that this hyper specialization can come at a cost. If we're not careful, we end up with a world full of experts who excel within their narrow domains but struggle to connect the dots across disciplines or grapple with complex, multifaceted problems. It's

Unknown Speaker  07:46
like having all the pieces of the puzzle, yes, but no idea how to put them together exactly,

Unknown Speaker  07:50
and that's

Unknown Speaker  07:52
where ELT come in. Okay? By understanding that learning is an ongoing cycle of experiencing, reflecting, thinking and acting, right, we can start to bridge those gaps. So

Unknown Speaker  08:02
it's not about abandoning specialization altogether, but about finding ways to balance it, yes, with a broader, more integrative learning experience. Exactly.

Unknown Speaker  08:11
It's about cultivating what cold calls an integrative perspective, okay, the ability to synthesize knowledge from different sources, see connections that others miss, and approach challenges from multiple angles. It

Unknown Speaker  08:25
makes you wonder if our current education system is really setting us up for success. You know, right in a world that increasingly demands adaptability and the ability to connect seemingly disparate ideas,

Unknown Speaker  08:37
it's a question worth pondering. It is, what if, instead of funneling students into narrow majors, we encourage them to explore a range of disciplines, to collaborate on projects that require interdisciplinary thinking, right, right, to embrace the messiness of real world problem solving, we

Unknown Speaker  08:55
could learn so much from places like art schools, right? Absolutely, where the emphasis is on creative exploration and hands on learning and constant feedback. And it's

Unknown Speaker  09:04
not just about changing the curriculum. Yeah, it's about shifting the entire learning space. Imagine universities where departments aren't siloed off. Oh, wow. But instead encourage cross disciplinary collaboration, where students and faculty from different backgrounds come together to tackle real world challenges

Unknown Speaker  09:20
that'd be amazing. I can already picture it. Engineers working alongside artists, yes, sociologists collaborating with computer scientists. Exactly talk about a breeding ground for innovation,

Unknown Speaker  09:30
and that's the power of ELT Wow. It gives us a framework, not just for understanding how we learn as individuals, but for reimagining how we learn as a society.

Unknown Speaker  09:44
This has been eye opening like it makes you realize that learning isn't just about accumulating knowledge. It's not it's about developing the skills and mindsets that allow us to constantly adapt, evolve and find our place in a world that's constantly changing, and

Unknown Speaker  09:58
that's a journey we're all on. Yeah, we are, whether we realize it or not. ELT simply gives us a map and a compass to navigate that journey with more intention and purpose. You know,

Unknown Speaker  10:09
it's funny, we always talk about finding our place in the world. What if our place isn't fixed? What if, like through learning and growth, we're constantly creating and recreating that space? It's

Unknown Speaker  10:20
a beautiful way to put it, and it

Unknown Speaker  10:22
speaks to a concept that's central to both ELT and personal development, okay, the idea of becoming we're not static beings. We're always in a state of flux, integrating new experiences, refining our understanding, evolving into something more. It reminds

Unknown Speaker  10:39
me of that Carl Jung quote, yeah, the privilege of a lifetime is being who you are, right? But the you in that quote, it isn't fixed. It's constantly like unfolding Exactly.

Unknown Speaker  10:51
And ELT gives us work for understanding that unfolding, okay? It's not just about acquiring knowledge, about developing the skills and the self awareness to navigate that journey of becoming

Unknown Speaker  11:03
so how do we actually do that? How do we take like these insights of ELT and apply them to our own lives, especially in a world that often feels like it's moving so fast? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  11:14
it starts with awareness. Okay, take some time to reflect on your own learning style, right? What energizes you? What kinds of learning experiences have been most impactful for you?

Unknown Speaker  11:23
And don't just think about formal education, right? Like think about those aha moments you've had, those times you've really stretched yourself and learn something new. Once

Unknown Speaker  11:34
you have a better understanding of your learning style, okay, you can start to create spaces that support it. Okay? Maybe that means seeking out mentors who challenge you in a way

Unknown Speaker  11:45
that resonates with your preferred learning mode, right?

Unknown Speaker  11:47
Or, like, finding a workplace that really values collaboration exactly, if you're a diverger, yeah, gives you the autonomy to experiment if you're more of an Accommodator,

Unknown Speaker  11:58
exactly, it's about aligning your environment with your natural inclinations. But it's also about being intentional. Okay, don't be afraid to step outside of your comfort zone and experiment with different

Unknown Speaker  12:09
learning approaches, because

Unknown Speaker  12:10
even if you gravitate toward a particular style, yeah, doesn't mean you can't benefit from like, incorporating elements of the others Exactly, exactly. It's a cycle. It's a dance. It is, you know, imagine a diverger who learns to channel their creative energy into practical solutions, or

Unknown Speaker  12:28
a converger who discovers the power of brainstorming and collaboration. That's

Unknown Speaker  12:33
where the real magic happens, yes, when we can tap into the full spectrum of our learning potential, right? And we unlock all these possibilities we never even imagined. And that's

Unknown Speaker  12:42
what I find so exciting about ELT, yeah, it's not just a theory. It's an invitation, an invitation to become more conscious, more intentional, and ultimately more fully ourselves through the transformative power of learning.

Unknown Speaker  12:56
I love that. Yeah, this has been an incredible deep dive. It has. We've explored the core principles of ELT, unpacked the nuances of learning styles he did, and even reimagined what education and workplaces could look like if we designed them with ELT in mind. It's exciting stuff. It really is. It's a whole new way of looking at things as you move forward. Yeah, I encourage you, the listener, to approach learning not as a destination, but as a lifelong adventure. Embrace your unique learning style. Seek out spaces that ignite your curiosity and never stop exploring the vast potential that lies within you. Well said. Until next time, Happy Learning.
